<!-- Based off of an initial email from RVM to TS -->

The workshop is intended to be very loosely structured as follows:

## (i) Studying for university tests & exams

1. _How_ to study---reading like a parrot vs reading with understanding
2. How _much_ to study
3. _What_ to study---getting bogged down in "facts" vs conceptual understanding

## (ii) Reading university text & exam questions

1. Practicing understanding what questions are asking
2. Understanding how to structure an answer

## (iii) Practice questions on your own

Some of the practice questions will be left for the students to try on their own. We will go over their answers together in the second session.
