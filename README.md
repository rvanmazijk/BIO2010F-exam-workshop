BIO2010F exam workshop structure
================
Lead by:

2019

<!-- Based off of an initial email from RVM to TS -->
The workshop is intended to be very loosely structured as follows:

(i) Studying for university tests & exams
-----------------------------------------

1.  *How* to study---reading like a parrot vs reading with understanding
2.  How *much* to study
3.  *What* to study---getting bogged down in "facts" vs conceptual understanding

(ii) Reading university text & exam questions
---------------------------------------------

1.  Practicing understanding what questions are asking
2.  Understanding how to structure an answer

(iii) Practice questions on your own
------------------------------------

Some of the practice questions will be left for the students to try on their own. We will go over their answers together in the second session.
